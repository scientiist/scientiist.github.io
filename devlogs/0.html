    <h1>Devlog 0 - </h1><h3>20th of April, 2020</h3>
    <a href="/rungun/devlog/0.html">last devlog</a> <a href="/rungun/devlog/1.html">next devlog</a> 
    <p>Me being me, I'm starting this devlog series partially through development of the game. So i'll go ahead and catch ye up on what's cooking.</p>
    <p>After getting cleaned up from CaveGame, I sat down to think about the next project, and what I wanted to do with it. Networking was unexplored territory to me, as well as cross-platform software. So I decided to do that.</p>
