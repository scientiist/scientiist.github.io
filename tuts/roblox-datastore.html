	<h3>Disclaimer: This is not intented to be some end-all-be-all book of knowledge or what have you. I'm simply attempting to supply less-skilled scripters with some explanations and examples on the topic.</h3>

	<h2>What's DataStore and why do I care?</h2>
	
	<p>In ROBLOX and game development, you will often find you want to have persistent data about the player, or game in general. In ROBLOX, the main way to accomplish this through the DataStore Service.</p>
	
	<a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/DataStoreService">http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/DataStoreService</a>
	
	<p><b>NOTE:</b> Data Persistance is the predecessor of DataStore, it is quite old, and deprecated. If you find yourself with a game using Data Persistance, I recommend converting to DataStore.</p>


	<h2> How's it work?</h2>
	<p>DataStore is often misunderstood and incorrectly used by newer scripters, but it's really quite simple and nothing to be scared of. Each "game" (Universe, if you prefer) in ROBLOX has shared DataStore, a common misconception being that each place has it's own DataStores, or that they're shared across all ROBLOX games.</p>

	<p>To access a DataStore, you call the <code>GetDataStore(name, scope)</code> method of DataStoreService. It returns a datastore with that given name and scope. Scope will default to <code>"global"</code> if not specified.</p>
	<a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/GlobalDataStore">http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/GlobalDataStore</a>

	<p>Once you've grabbed your DataStore, you can read and write to it using the <code>GetAsync</code>, <code>SetAsync</code>, <code>IncrementAsync</code> and <code>UpdateAsync</code> methods. These are all pretty self-explainatory.</p>
	
	<p>Keep in mind that DataStore has several limitations. Because of these, it is recommended to use DataStore rather infrequently. Generally you will see games that load and save data when the player leaves and joins, and/or autosaving at 5-10 minute intervals.</p>
	
	<a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Data_store#Limitations">http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Data_store#Limitations</a>
	<h2>Example One: Saving a number</h2>
	
	<p>This first example should be run in a Script on the server (Preferably ServerScriptService). To start we just grab the service and a DataStore that we want.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local dss = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local myDS = dss:GetDataStore("numbers")</code></pre>
	<p>Next we are going to use GetAsync to grab a specific number from our DataStore.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local myNum = myDS:GetAsync("number1")</code></pre>

	<p><b>NOTE:</b> If a key in a DataStore has never been set before, it will return <code>nil</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">if myNum == nil then
	myNum = 0	
end</code></pre>
	<p>After this, we're going to send <code>myNum</code> back into the DataStore.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">myDS:SetAsync("number1", myNum+1) -- increase myNum so we can see the difference</code></pre>

	<p>Play with this example if you like, output the result to a Billboard or something</p>
	
	<h2>Example Two: Counting player join times.</h2>

	<p>Hopefully you're a little more comfortable with DataStores at this point, so we're going to try something a bit more involved. We'll start off this tutorial with some boilerplate that doesn't have much to do with the actual DataStore</p>	
	
	<p>First up is a function <code>join</code> that we connect to the PlayerAdded event.</p>

<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Server Script
local dss = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local myDS = dss:GetDataStore("joins")

local function join(player)
	
end
		
game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(join)</code></pre>

	<p>The rest of this example will occur inside of <code>join</code>.  Once our boilerplate is set up, we're going to grab the player's join times when they join, increase it, and send it back to the DataStore.</p>
	
<pre><code class="language-lua">local key = "plr"..player.UserId -- we create a string "key" to store the player's data by userId
-- this is good practice, as if the player changes name, the data remains
local timesJoined = myDS:GetAsync(key)

-- then we do the normal checks
if timesJoined == nil then timesJoined = 0 end

print(timesJoined)

-- after that, we'll send it back to the DataStore
myDS:SetAsync(key, timesJoined+1)</code></pre>
	
	<p>If all works fine, you'll now see the number of times the player has previously played this game in the console when they join</p> 
	
	<h2>Some Exercises</h2>
	<p>Now that you're familiar with DataStore, I encourage you to try some of the below exercises and see what you can make</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Save/Load leaderstats (Kills, WO's, etc)</li>
		<li>Keep track of time spent in-game</li>
		<li>Keep track of who a player has touched</li>
		<li>Save/Load player's location.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>OrderedDataStore</h2>

	<p>OrderedDataStore is a service similar to DataStore, but is different in that it only stores numbers, and is automatically sorted. At this current time of revision I don't actually know how ODS works, I plan on fleshing out this part of the tutorial later on</p>


	<h2>Common errors and problems</h2>
	
	<h4>Cannot write to DataStore from studio if API access is not enabled.</h4>
	<p>By default, studio API access is disabled, but you can enable it in the Configure Game page</p>
	<a href="http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Data_store#Using_Data_Stores_in_Studio">http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=Data_store#Using_Data_Stores_in_Studio</a>

	<h4>Cannot save instance</h4>
	<p>As previously stated, DataStore is incapable of saving instances (ROBLOX objects such as parts and scripts). Check your code to make sure that you're not accidentally attempting to save an instance</p>

	<h4>DataStore is throttling and not accepting my requests</h4>
	<p>This can happen when you over-use DataStore, and ROBLOX automatically throttles the service. Try to find any places in your code where you're using DataStore much more than you should (a fast-running loop, or changing the player's DataStore every time their stats update are common mistakes). You should develop your game to attempt data-saving a few times, and handle it appropriately if it cannot.</p>
